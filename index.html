        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>I am a master's student at the University of Chicago studying <a href="https://capp.uchicago.edu/">computational analysis and public policy</a>. I hope to use my skills and training to work toward meaningful, collaborative, human-centered insights from data in the public or nonprofit sector.</p>
        <p>Previously, I completed an internship at the <a href="https://gitlab.com/ccao-data-science---modeling">Cook County Assessor's Office</a> helping rebuild the county's residential valuation model and spent a year serving with <a href="https://americorps.gov/serve/fit-finder/americorps-vista">AmeriCorps VISTA</a> at an <a href="https://www.reuseworks.org/">environmental jobs nonprofit.</a></p>
        <p>My bachelor's degree is from <a href="https://www.sjc.edu/">St. John's College, Annapolis</a>, where I studied philosophy and the history of math and science.</p>
        <p>I enjoy hiking, road trips, and trying to read too many things at once.</p>
